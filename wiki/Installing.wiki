#summary How to install the toolchain on the iPhone.

= Introduction =

Here are some simple instructions to install the toolchain on the iPhone.  The guide assumes that BSD subsystem is installed.  There is a bit of command-line work, so either SSH package or Terminal + iphuc must be installed.  These packages were built and tested on firmware 1.1.4, but they may work on older firmwares, too.  YMMV

= Details =

All the packages from this project will go in /usr/local on the iPhone, so make sure you have plenty of space.  I chose to put my /usr/local on the Media partition.  Here are the steps (Terminal or SSH):
{{{
$ cd Media
$ mkdir local
$ login -pf root
Password:
# ln -s /var/mobile/Media/local /usr/local
# exit
$ exit
}}}
